# ThroneWorlds
## Star's Custom Multiplayer Gamemode!

Welcome to Star's Throne Worlds! Throne Worlds is a custom minecraft gamemode in which teams must venture out from skyblock-esque 'Throne Worlds' into the overworld in order to locate and destory the enemy queen to destabilise their throne world and secure final kills!

Throne Worlds is still under development, if you've participated in a playtest feel free to open an issue to make a suggestion or report a bug! You can access the most recent stable build under the target folder in the main branch. **Builds from other branches are experimental and may not function properly!**
If you'd like to participate in the next Throne Worlds Playtest, contact myself, or find out when the final version is complete, join our discord server at http://discord.ThroneWorlds.com!
